# BASH

## History

Throughout UNIX history, many shells developed, but only few of them widely used. Steve Bourne wrote a shell called "Bourne Shell", released in 1979. This was considered to be the first major one. It was made to be a scripting language that contains most of the features that are necessary to produce complex programs. It had control flow, variables, input-output control etc. After this, another widely used shell was the C shell, written by Bill Joy. It was a lot like the C programming language, and intended to be easier to use and learn for programmers. 

Bash, The Bourne-Again SHell, originally written by Brian Fox, first released in 1989. Name was a pun to the author of its direct ancestor, Steve Bourne. It was created to be used in GNU project. Bash includes the best features of C and Korn shells aside from its own advantages. The purpose of Bash was to be a standard shell for the GNU system. 
All versions of Bash since 0.99 have been freely available. Bash manage to be in every major version of UNIX and has rapidly become the most popular shell that is derived from the Bourne Shell. It is the standard shell in Linux. Chet Ramey is the current maintainer of Bash.

- Things that are specific to this language?


A good strategy would be to find the official documentation of the language and a few useful internet articles and compile whatever you can learn from all the resources into one report with your own sentences.


Reports will be graded according to how well all the required information is explained.
